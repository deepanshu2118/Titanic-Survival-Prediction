# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The project uses the Titanic dataset, which is one of the most well-known datasets in the data science community.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset includes the following features:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID of the passenger
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

The target variable is:

- **Survived**: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)

## Project Structure

- `titanic_data.csv`: The dataset file.
- `titanic_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the project.
- `model.pkl`: Trained model saved for future use.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

After the prediction of the Titanic Survival .we making the the steamlit app for the suitable use for the titanic survival prediction .
This the very interesting app and the one of the most important tool streamlit for the help in the making the app.
